	<h2>DeconstruCTF Writeup</h2>
    <h3><strong>Intro</strong></h3>
    <p>This past Friday and Saturday was Google’s DesconstruCTF, which is a capture the flag competition for teams and individuals around the world; it included challenges about web application exploitation, cryptography, OSINT, and more.  This was my first timed CTF so I wasn’t too worried about completing a ton of challenges, I really just wanted to get in and see what I could do.  In the end I wound up completing just one challenge, but I got pretty far in another.  I’ll start by going over how I was able to complete that challenge, before I move on to where I struggled in the other challenges, and finish up by talking about my next steps.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Here's a Flag</h3>
    <p>This is the first challenge in the Web section.  It focused on understanding the front-end of a web application.  </p>
    <img src="/style/heres_a_flag.png" alt="Screenshot of clue for first challenge">
    <p>Above you can see the clue and the site where this flag is hidden.  The first step is to go to the site and see what I’m working with.</p>
    <img src="/style/flag_page.png" alt="Screenshot of page with first flag">
    <p>In this case, the entire page is just this CSS-built flag.  The next step is to go into the CSS and take a quick look for clues.  </p>
    <img src="/style/error_messages.png" alt="Error message relating to unknown properties- flag and caesar-cipher">
    <p>Upon looking in the console, there are these two unknown properties.  Looking directly at the CSS text, the flag and caesar-cipher properties are pretty easy to find.</p>
    <img src="/style/css_flag.png" alt="CSS code for flag and caesar-cipher">
    <p>Since this flag property looks nothing like CSS, it’s a safe bet to assume this is the answer to the challenge, but upon pasting the text into the answer box I am told that this answer is incorrect.  Looking back at the CSS, it’s now time to consider this caesar-cipher.  So I searched for a caesar-cipher decoder website so that I can find the answer faster than doing it by hand.  The shift I assume to be three, and even if there was no way to determine the shift the answer space is small enough to brute force.  </p>
    <p>The resulting string is accepted by the site (after a little fiddling with it) and that’s the first flag.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Where I Struggled</h3>
    <p>In the next challenge I was sent to another site, this time I was searching for an admin page on the website.  So I clicked through all the links and found nothing.  My next step was to search the sitemap and robots.txt (this was based on a hint that no search engine could find the admin page).  The sitemap was not found, but the robots.txt file showed there were two paths that were disallowed- the first was for the JS and CSS code for the site, but the other was a blank page that said admin.  Upon further inspection of the source it was clear that there were two hidden fields on the page- a username and a password.  There was also an action that led to another page, but when I tried to navigate to that page I was given an error that showed that my method was not allowed.  Upon further inspection of the source code I found that the only HTTP method allowed was Post; my next move was to go to the terminal and use a cURL command to try to see the contents of this next page.  The results of my HTTP Post to this hidden page was that I was returned a token which said, “YOU LIED TO ME !!!”  I was unable to find how I could leverage this token to move forward, and I could not figure out any other clues as to how I could advance.  </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>Most of the knowledge I leveraged for this CTF came from completing rooms on TryHackMe, so I plan to return to THM and keep solving rooms.  I also looked into a couple of the cryptography challenges and was completely overwhelmed, it’s clear that I need to do a lot more research before I’m able to even start on those.  </p>
