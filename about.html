    <p>This is my personal website.  I have opted for a simple design to minimize the amount of data that must be transmitted as well as stored, for the purposes of both accessibility and for speed.  I built this site to share a lot of what I have learned, because I believe that the tech industry should have as low a barrier to entry as possible.  I try to share any free and helpful resources that I come across for this reason.  And while many sites do offer lots of resources for free and from experts in their field, this site is meant only to supplement those resources, this is not at all meant to be a one-stop-shop for learning anything; this is why I aim to lean on all these other resources and redirect to said resources when applicable.  </p>
    <p>On this site you will find many of my notes, my explanations, and what I've read.  Free resources can be found in my dedicated GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/willisman31/CIS-Resources">here</a>.</p>

    <h4 class="about-me">About Me</h4>
    <p>I am a non-degree masters student at Old Dominion University studying Computer Science.  I frequently find myself searching for answers beyond what we discuss in class.  When I learn about a topic, I try to get to the bottom of it and understand it from first principles.  This approach requires a lot of resources, so I hope that this site can help others who think and learn like I do.</p>
    <p>I currently hold a Security+ certification from CompTIA as well as a Cloud Practitioner Certification from AWS and several fundamentals certifications from Azure. I am studying for a CySA+ certification from CompTIA and working on my networking skills. </p>
    <p>In my spare time I compete in capture the flag competitions under the team name hacienda.  As of writing I am in the top 2% of Try Hack Me participants.</p>
