    <h4 class="about-this-site">About This Site</h4>
    <p>This is my personal website.  I have opted for a simple design to minimize the amount of data that must be transmitted as well as stored, for the purposes of both accessibility and for speed.  I built this site to share a lot of what I have learned, because I believe that the tech industry should have as low a barrier to entry as possible.  I try to share any free and helpful resources that I come across for this reason.  And while many sites do offer lots of resources for free and from experts in their field, this site is meant only to supplement those resources, this is not at all meant to be a one-stop-shop for learning anything; this is why I aim to lean on all these other resources and redirect to said resources when applicable.  </p>
    <p>On this site you will find many of my notes, my explanations, and what I've read.  Free resources can be found in my dedicated GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/willisman31/CIS-Resources">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h4 class="about-me">About Me</h4>
    <p>I am a student in the College of Business at James Madison University studying Computer Information Systems with an expected graduation date of December 2021.  I have often found myself frustrated by the lack of resources that are made available by my professors and just as frequently have found myself searching for answers that my professors are unable to give me.  When I learn about a topic, I try to get to the bottom of it and understand it from first principles.  This approach requires a lot of resources, so I hope that this site can help others who think and learn like I do.</p>
    <p>I currently hold a Security+ certification from CompTIA and am studying for a CySA+ certification from CompTIA and a CCP certification from AWS.</p>
